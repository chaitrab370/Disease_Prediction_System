# Disease_Prediction_System
Disease prediction using symptoms with multiple ML algorithms

## Algorithms Used
- Naive Bayes  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- XGBoost  

## Features
- Interactive interface built in Jupyter Notebook  
- Dropdown menus to select up to 5 symptoms  
- Predicts disease using multiple ML algorithms  
- Displays accuracy for each model  

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., `Disease_Prediction_System.ipynb`)  
2. Run all cells in order  
3. Select 5 symptoms from the dropdown lists  
4. View disease predictions from each algorithm along with their accuracies
